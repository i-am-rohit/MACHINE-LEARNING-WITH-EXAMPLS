        "AdaBoost, short for Adaptive Boosting, is a machine learning algorithm used for classification and regression tasks. It falls under the category of ensemble methods, which combine multiple \"weak learners\" to create a more robust \"strong learner.\"<br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Benefits:\n",
        "\n",
        "Improved Accuracy: By combining multiple weak learners, AdaBoost can often achieve better classification or regression performance compared to a single model.<br>\n",
        "Flexibility: It can work with various types of weak learners, making it adaptable to different data types and problems.<br>\n",
        "Robust to Outliers: By focusing on correcting errors from previous models, AdaBoost can be less sensitive to outliers in the data compared to some other learning algorithms. <br><br>\n",
        "\n",
        "Drawbacks:\n",
        "\n",
        "Computationally Expensive: Training multiple models can be computationally expensive, especially for large datasets.<br>\n",
        "Sensitive to Noise: AdaBoost can be sensitive to noisy data, as assigning high weights to noisy examples can lead to poor performance.<br>\n",
        "Overfitting: If the weak learners are too complex or the number of iterations is too high, AdaBoost can potentially overfit the training data."
